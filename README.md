## From TypeScript To Rescript

This is an example of [Inhyped](https://inhyped.com/) frontend codebase initially written in TypeScript and then
fully rewritten in [ReScript](https://inhyped.com/).

It's published for educational purpose and pursues a goal to demonstrate what a real ReScript project may look like.

The rewriting process was accompanied with [tweets with hashtag #FromTypescriptToRescript](https://twitter.com/hashtag/FromTypescriptToRescript).

The author does not consider himself an excellent frontend developer and both versions are far from being perfectly polished, so keep it in mind.

The source code comes without corresponding backend part. To get a feeling of what the project does,
it's recommended visiting [inhyped.com](https://inhyped.com/)

### Running ReScript

Install dependencies:

```
cd rescript
npm install
```

Start ReScript/OCaml compiler with watcher:

```
npm run watch
```

Serve the assets:

```
npm run start
```
